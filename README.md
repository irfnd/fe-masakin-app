# ReactJS with Eslint + Prettier Setup

My ReactJS boilerplate with eslint & prettier setup and jsconfig for absolute project path.

## Get Started

- Clone this repo
  ```bash
  git clone https://github.com/irfnd/react-boilerplate-eslint-prettier
  ```
- Rename this boilerplate to whatever you want
  ```bash
  cd <your-project-name>
  ```
- Delete .git folder
- Reinitialize your git
  ```bash
  git init .
  git add .
  git commit -m "Your initialize commit"
  ```
- Install all packages
  ```bash
  npm install
  ```
  or
  ```bash
  yarn
  ```
- Project ready.
- You can push/publish to your own github by changing some configuration in `package.json` based on the configuration you want.
